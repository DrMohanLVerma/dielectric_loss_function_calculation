# Dielectric Loss Function Script

### Description
This script automatically takes input your `epsilon_real.out` & `epsilon_real.out` files and combines them into a `.dat` file. Which is then used to calculate the dielectric loss and plots the energies and loss function.It also creates a `loss_function.dat` file as output.
##

### Usage
> Save this script in the folder where you have your `epsilon_real.out` and `epsilon_img.out` files.

> To run the script open terminal and input the following command:

```
python3 mlv_dielectric_loss_script.py
